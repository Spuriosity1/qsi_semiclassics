/* Returns a sample from the von Mises distribution
 *     p(x) ~ exp(kappa * cos(x-mu))
 * in the form exp(i*x).
 *
 * Uses the rejection algorithm compared against the wrapped Cauchy
 * distribution suggested by Best and Fisher and documented in
 * Chapter 9 of Luc's Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation.
 *
 * Addition from A.Sz.: very large kappa is handled with a wrapped Gaussian
 * distribution. It is accurate to almost macheps there.
