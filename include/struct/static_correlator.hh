    /* ---------- Arrays of Fourier transforms ----------
     * Since we look at functions defined on an fcc lattice, using FFTW naively
     * creates two Brillouin zones, with all q-point included.
     * We are only interested in the (hhk) plane, and also, there is no need to
     * store but half of each array.
     * This is accomplished by keeping only lines whose q_x and q_y coordinates
     * are equal and cutting them in half along the q_z axis.
     * The stored q-points then come from one (rather unconventional) reciprocal
     * space unit cell.
     *
     * Furthermore, the only correlators that are non-zero under our Hamiltonian
     * are <S^zS^z> and <S^+S^->. Accordingly, only these spin FT's and
     * correlators are stored, as well 3 proxies for Hermele's magnetic field:
     **  <bb> where b = Im(S^+S^-...)  (in S_b[0]);
     **  <BB> where B = arg(S^+S^-...) (in S_b[1]);
     **  <sin(B) sin(B)>               (in S_b[2]). */
