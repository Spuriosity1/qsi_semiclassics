/* Executable to find mean frequency and total structure factor
 *
 * Input file is assumed to contain "lines" of a fixed number of double
 * precision floats. These lines are summed and their first moments taken to
 * find the total structure factor and mean frequency, resp. These are printed
 * in the output file.
 *
 * Usage: mean_freq line_length infile outfile
