/* Executable to average over several files containing real numbers
 *
 * Assumes all files are binary containing a stream of double precision floats

 * These are loaded, each position is averaged over, and then printed into
 * the output file.
 *
 * Usage: average infile1 [infile2 [infile3 [...]]] outfile
